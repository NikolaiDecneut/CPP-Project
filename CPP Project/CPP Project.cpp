/*
Name: Nikolai Decneut
Problem: Write a program that lets the user choose the limits of random numbers and characters. First, find a random float between 0.0 and 1.0 (exclusive of 1.0).
Then, have the user choose upper and lower values for a random int, a random float, and a random character.
You decide whether the maximum values will be included or excluded in the range.
Label the output and output each random item on a separate line.
Pseudocode:
find a float between 0.0 and 1.0
get the user to input a minimum and maximum int variables
get the user to input a minimum and maximum float variables
get the user to input a minimum and maximum character variables
label the output
output each item on a seperate line
Notes:  i dont understand how to do the last part
Maintenance Log :
